By straightforward calculation using the facts that _inline_math_ is unitary, _inline_math_ is a projection and _inline_math_ and _inline_math_ commute, we can verify that _inline_math_ given by _inline_math_ extends to a _inline_math_-homomorphsim from _inline_math_ to _inline_math_ satisfying _inline_math_.

We have that _inline_math_ involves derivatives of _inline_math_ only up to order one, and hence, _inline_math_ is a sum of terms of the same type which we have already encountered in _inline_math_ So, its integral can be bounded in the same type. Indeed, () shows that _inline_math_ depends on _inline_math_ _inline_math_ and derivatives of lower order. By using () we have the claim. Theorem 8.2(Main Theorem).

Since _inline_math_ is fixed, this result is valid over the whole interval _inline_math_ ', ' We show now a fundamental a priori estimate used for a basic local-in-time existence theorem.

This property tells us that _inline_math_ where _inline_math_ is a ball in _inline_math_ To guarantee this property, we will appeal to an a priori estimate which is the main object of this section. Differentiating () two times leads to (4.1) _inline_math_ Let _inline_math_ where _inline_math_ Hence _inline_math_ then _inline_math_ where _inline_math_ Replacing in () we have (4.2) _inline_math_ _inline_math_ The () equation is linearized by substituting a new variable _inline_math_ in each coefficient: (4.3) _inline_math_ _inline_math_ The linear equation which is to be solved at each iteration is of the form (4.4) _inline_math_ where _inline_math_ Equation () is a linear equation at each iteration which can be solved in any interval of time in which the coefficient is defined.

Proof. Let _inline_math_ be arbitrary and _inline_math_ a constant. Let _inline_math_ then in () we have _inline_math_ We consider the bilinear form _inline_math_ _inline_math_ where _inline_math_ We have _inline_math_ _inline_math_ _inline_math_ _inline_math_ _inline_math_ _inline_math_ Subtracting and integrating over _inline_math_ we have _inline_math_ _inline_math_ _inline_math_ Each term is treated separately, integrating by parts _inline_math_ _inline_math_ _inline_math_ _inline_math_ The other terms are calculates in a similar way.

Therefore, _inline_math_ is an inner product on _inline_math_ We denote by _inline_math_ the completion of _inline_math_ with respect to this inner product. By Riesz’s Representation Theorem, there exists a unique solution _inline_math_ such that for any _inline_math_ _inline_math_ where we use that _inline_math_ Then if _inline_math_ we have _inline_math_ or _inline_math_ Hence, _inline_math_ is a weak solution of _inline_math_ with _inline_math_ Remark. To obtain higher regularity of the solution, we repeat the proof with higher derivatives. It is a standard approximation procedure to obtain a result for general initial data. The next step is to estimate the corresponding solutions _inline_math_ of the equation () via the coefficients of that equation. The following estimate is related to the existence of solutions theorem. Lemma 4.2. Let _inline_math_ and _inline_math_ with _inline_math_ real constants.

Hence, _inline_math_ _inline_math_ _inline_math_ _inline_math_ _inline_math_ Using that _inline_math_ and a standard estimate, the lemma follows. ', ' Here, we will try to extend the local solution _inline_math_ of () obtained in Theorem 5.2 to _inline_math_ A standard way to obtain these extensions consists into deducing global estimations for the _inline_math_-norm of _inline_math_ in terms of the _inline_math_-norm of _inline_math_ These estimations are frequently based on conservation laws which contain the _inline_math_-norm of the solution and their spatial derivatives. It is not possible to do the same to give a solution of the problem of global existence because the difficulty here is that the weight depends on the _inline_math_ and _inline_math_ variables. To solve our problem we follow a different method using Leibniz’s rule like in the proof of Theorem 3.1 of Bona and Saut _citation_. Theorem 6.1.

In general, it is formulated as an inverse problem for the wave equation. However, in the case of the constant sound speed, it can be also described in terms of a spherical mean operator (a spherical analog of the Radon transform). The section also contains the list of natural questions to be addressed concerning this model. These issues are addressed then one by one in the following sections. In particular, Section discusses uniqueness of reconstruction, i.e. the question of whether the data collected in TAT is sufficient for recovery of the information of interest. Albeit, for all practical purposes this issue is resolved in Corollary , we provide an additional discussion of unresolved uniqueness problems, which are probably of more academic interest. Section addresses inversion formulas and algorithms. In Section effects of having only partial data are discussed. Section contains results concerning the so called range conditions, i.e. the conditions that all ideal data must satisfy. Section provides additional remarks and discussions of the issues raised in the previous sections. The paper ends with an Acknowledgments section and bibliography. Concerning the latter, we need to mention that the engineering and biomedical literature on TAT is rather vast and no attempt has been made in this text to create a comprehensive bibliography of the topic from the engineering prospective.

', ' If _inline_math_ is a differential operator on _inline_math_ a temperate fundamental solution to _inline_math_ is a distribution _inline_math_ such that _inline_math_, where _inline_math_ is the delta-Dirac distribution at the origin. Fundamental solutions play a major role in the theory of PDE. For a large overview on this subject, and applications, we refer to _citation_ vol. 1 & 2. It is well known, see e.g. _citation_, that differential operators with constant coefficients have temperate fundamental solutions. But, apart in very trivial cases like the Laplacian, it is difficult to produce explicitly a solution. The case of order 3 homogeneous operators, in dimension 3, was treated in _citation_. Always in dimension 3, the case of elliptic quartic operators was considered in _citation_ and our contribution in _citation_ was to obtain temperate fundamental solutions for homogeneous elliptic operators of any degree and in any dimension. Also, we mention that the book of J.E. Björk _citation_ contains a very nice study of the algebraic and analytic properties of fundamental solutions for operators with polynomial or analytic symbols and constant coefficients. In particular the presence of logarithmic distributions, as occurring in the present contribution, is predicted in a very general setting. Hypotheses and definitions. We are here interested in the case of a non-definite homogenous polynomial _inline_math_ on _inline_math_, i.e., _inline_math_. In all this article _inline_math_ is the degree of _inline_math_. To simplify, we restrict our study to a real principal type singularity, i.e. we assume that: _display_math_ But _inline_math_ complex valued is admissible, see section 2. In what follows, we write: _display_math_ the trace of the characteristic set of _inline_math_ on the unit-sphere. In terms of polar coordinates, _inline_math_ implies that the restriction of _inline_math_ to _inline_math_ satisfies: _display_math_ By a standard result of differential geometry, see e.g. _citation_ chapter 3, condition _inline_math_ insures the existence of a canonical (n-2)-dimensional measure _inline_math_ smooth on the level sets _inline_math_, for _inline_math_ small enough. This measure, traditionally called Liouville or Guelfand-Leray measure, satisfies the coarea formula: _display_math_ for all _inline_math_ with support in _inline_math_. This relation defines a new function: _inline_math_, obtained by integration of _inline_math_ in the fibers _inline_math_ w.r.t. _inline_math_. By Sard’s Theorem this function is finite almost everywhere and for any _inline_math_ it is easy to check that _inline_math_ can be extended as an integrable function with compact support _inline_math_. With these elementary facts in mind we introduce: ', ' Proof. To blow up the singularity, we use polar coordinates _inline_math_. By homogeneity we have _inline_math_. First if _inline_math_ we choose: (3) _display_math_ We have _inline_math_ in a conical neighborhood of _inline_math_. The sign is obviously given by the sign of _inline_math_ and the Jacobian is _inline_math_. Next, if _inline_math_ by condition _inline_math_ and by homogeneity we have _inline_math_. We can assume that _inline_math_ and we chose: _display_math_ We have: _display_math_ By continuity, this result holds in a sufficiently small neighborhood of _inline_math_. Since _inline_math_ is a compact subset of _inline_math_ we can easily globalize the construction._inline_math_ To use these normal forms, we construct an adapted partition of unity on _inline_math_. We pick a family of positive function _inline_math_ on _inline_math_ such that: _display_math_ with the existence of a normal form _inline_math_ inside each _inline_math_. Next, since the previous construction depends only on the set _inline_math_, we can assume that _inline_math_ for _inline_math_ chosen small enough so that the measures _inline_math_ are well defined on each _inline_math_. Finally we can complete this finite set as partition of unity on _inline_math_ with _inline_math_. The support of _inline_math_ is generally not connected, as shows the case _inline_math_. With this partition of unity we have: _display_math_ With this localization argument we use Lemma to trivialize locally the problem and we have to study the elementary quantities: _display_math_ _display_math_ These new functions are obtained by pullback and integration: _display_math_ _display_math_ where _inline_math_ stands for the pullback including the multiplication by the Jacobian. Trivial contribution. We start by the analytic continuation of the elliptic part _inline_math_. We have: _display_math_ and after _inline_math_ integrations by parts we obtain: _display_math_ The integral in the r.h.s. defines an holomorphic function near _inline_math_. The constant term of the Laurent series at the origin, determined by the rational function, is given by: _display_math_ With the holomorphic function near _inline_math_: _display_math_ we obtain: _display_math_ Clearly _inline_math_ and a direct computation yields: _display_math_ Here _inline_math_ is the usual polygamma function of order 0 and _display_math_ is Euler’s constant. Non-trivial contribution. Now, we study the singular term _inline_math_. We have: _display_math_ _display_math_ Accordingly, _inline_math_ is a pole of order 2 of the meromorphic extension: _display_math_ The constant term of the Laurent expansion is given by: _display_math_ Hence with the auxiliary functions: _display_math_ _display_math_ we obtain that the term of interest is given by: (4) _display_math_ By some elementary calculations we obtain respectively: _display_math_ _display_math_ The coefficient _inline_math_ plays no rôle here, see Eq.() below. The next step is to evaluate _inline_math_ in the coordinates _inline_math_. After integration by parts w.r.t. _inline_math_, we have: (5) _display_math_ For the next distributional coefficient we find that: _display_math_ (6) _display_math_ Finally, we obtain similarly: _display_math_ _display_math_ (7) _display_math_ After expanding the square in the integral we have, once more, discarded the term attached to _inline_math_, vanishing after integration w.r.t. _inline_math_. Invariant formulation. To achieve the proof we must formulate our distributions in a geometrical way, also independent of the partition of unity attached to the coordinates _inline_math_. First, by construction, we have to evaluate our distribution on _inline_math_ so that after Fourier transformation _inline_math_. Since _inline_math_ is of degree _inline_math_, we have _inline_math_ near _inline_math_. Same remark for _inline_math_ near _inline_math_. These properties are important since several coefficient expressed below are related to Dirac-delta distributions supported in _inline_math_. According to Eq.() and Eq.() at worst 3 different terms occur which we treat separately distinguishing out the case of _inline_math_ locally integrable or not. 1-Contribution of the elliptic directions. We have: _display_math_ If _inline_math_ this term vanishes and for _inline_math_ we have: _display_math_ This identity holds after inversion of our diffeomorphism and the substitution _inline_math_. When _inline_math_, we can integrate by parts the logarithmic contribution to obtain: _display_math_ _display_math_ Observe that the integral w.r.t. _inline_math_ is precisely convergent, for any _inline_math_, if and only if _inline_math_. If _inline_math_ this argument does not holds, but we can write: _display_math_ After inversion of our diffeomorphism and scaling out the spherical term _inline_math_ in the phase, we obtain the contribution: _display_math_ 2-Contribution of the non-elliptic directions. To express our amplitudes, we use the Schwartz kernel technique. Let _inline_math_, _inline_math_, then: _display_math_ _display_math_ For this integral we can inverse our diffeomorphism via _inline_math_ and _inline_math_, locally on _inline_math_. For the _inline_math_-integration we can extend the integrand by 0 for _inline_math_ and we obtain first: _display_math_ _display_math_ The remaining integral is simply the exterior derivative, of order _inline_math_, of the Liouville measure on the surface _inline_math_. For _inline_math_, observe that: _display_math_ _display_math_ and that by construction the functions _inline_math_ are smooth. Choosing _inline_math_, we have obtained: _display_math_ (8) _display_math_ By degree considerations w.r.t. _inline_math_ we have respectively: _display_math_ _display_math_ Where _inline_math_ and _inline_math_ are obtained by inserting Eq.() in the integrals. Finally, in Eq.() the term attached to the product of logarithms is given by: _display_math_ _display_math_ For _inline_math_ integrations by parts are not allowed but we can anyhow conclude with Eq.(). We treat now separately parts A) and B) of Theorem . Proof of part A). To obtain the final result we sum over the partition of unity. According to the considerations of homogeneity above, for _inline_math_ the full contribution is generated by _inline_math_ and _inline_math_. With the explicit values of _inline_math_ and _inline_math_, we obtain that _inline_math_ equals: _display_math_ With _inline_math_ near _inline_math_, we have _inline_math_ in a neighborhood of _inline_math_. Hence, in the first term, the integral w.r.t. _inline_math_ equals: _display_math_ The derivation is in sense of distributions. For the coefficients attached to _inline_math_ we obtain: _display_math_ Since _inline_math_, via one integration by parts: _display_math_ Observe the minus sign which fits with the weak derivation above. Since for each _inline_math_ and _inline_math_, _inline_math_, we get: _display_math_ By integration w.r.t. _inline_math_ and summation over the partition of unity we obtain: _display_math_ which is the desired result when _inline_math_. Proof of part B). Now, we consider _inline_math_. All coefficients contribute via: _display_math_ _display_math_ _display_math_ If we split the integral with the logarithm we obtain two terms: _display_math_ _display_math_ Observe that, by construction, all integrals are well defined. First, we express the contributions near _inline_math_. Combining Eq.() and Eq.(), we find that: _display_math_ _display_math_ This term can be treated as in part A) and we obtain: _display_math_ Next, combining Eq.() and Eq.() we have: _display_math_ _display_math_ _display_math_ _display_math_ The last two integrals can be combined as above. For the others, we use: _display_math_ and proceed to integrations by parts, which is legal since the factors _inline_math_ vanish for _inline_math_ large and _inline_math_ also vanishes at the origin. We obtain: _display_math_ _display_math_ _display_math_ Observe that we have 3 different coefficients, like for the coefficients attached to the set _inline_math_. We combine each of these contributions by nature and by gathering carefully the constants. First, we consider the term involving two logarithms: _display_math_ _display_math_ _display_math_ The change of sign for comes from a derivation in the sense of distributions, a similar comment applies below. Next, we have: _display_math_ _display_math_ _display_math_ Finally, we combine the remaining terms to obtain: _display_math_ _display_math_ _display_math_ This proves parts B) of Theorem . Proof of Corollary We start by the analytic continuation of the elliptic part _inline_math_. The pole _inline_math_ is simple and the term of interest is given by: _display_math_ The value of this coefficient was determined in the proof of Theorem . ']}\n",
