The densification rate always exhibits at least\\none strong minimum, and resumes after an incubation period. Transmission\\nelectron microscopy investigations performed on sintered samples never revealed\\nextensive dislocation activity in the elemental grains. The densification\\nmechanism involved during SPS was determined by anisothermal (investigation of\\nthe heating stage of a SPS run) and isothermal methods (investigation at given\\nsoak temperatures). Grain-boundary sliding, accommodated by an in-series\\n{interface-reaction/lattice diffusion of the O$^2$-anions} mechanism controlled\\nby the interface-reaction step, governs densification. The\\nzero-densification-rate period, detected for all soak temperatures, arise from\\nthe difficulty of annealing vacancies, necessary for the densification to\\nproceed. The detection of atomic ledges at grain boundaries and the\\nmodification of the stoichiometry of spinel during SPS could be related to the\\ndifficulty to anneal vacancies at temperature soaks.',\n",

       "  'value': 'Spark plasma sintering (SPS) of MgAl2O4 powder was investigated at\\ntemperatures between 1200 and 1300{\\\\deg}C. A significant grain growth was\\nobserved during densification. The densification rate always exhibits at least\\none strong minimum, and resumes after an incubation period. Transmission\\nelectron microscopy investigations performed on sintered samples never revealed\\nextensive dislocation activity in the elemental grains. The densification\\nmechanism involved during SPS was determined by anisothermal (investigation of\\nthe heating stage of a SPS run) and isothermal methods (investigation at given\\nsoak temperatures). Grain-boundary sliding, accommodated by an in-series\\n{interface-reaction/lattice diffusion of the O$^2$-anions} mechanism controlled\\nby the interface-reaction step, governs densification. The\\nzero-densification-rate period, detected for all soak temperatures, arise from\\nthe difficulty of annealing vacancies, necessary for the densification to\\nproceed. The detection of atomic ledges at grain boundaries and the\\nmodification of the stoichiometry of spinel during SPS could be related to the\\ndifficulty to anneal vacancies at temperature soaks.'},\n",

associative quotients of vertex algebras. We also give a short construction of the Zhu algebra, and a proof of its associativity using elliptic functions.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\\\vspace*{10mm}\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\\\section{Introduction}\\\\label{section.intro}\\r\\n\\r\\n\\\\begin{nolabel}\\nLet $V$ be a vertex algebra. In \\\\cite{Zhu-thesis} and \\\\cite{Z96} Y. Zhu introduced two associative algebras $\\\\zhu(V)$ and $R_V$ constructed as quotients of $V$ equipped with products defined explicitly in terms of its $n^{\\\\text{th}}$ products. The purpose of this note is to present a brief and uniform construction of $\\\\zhu(V)$ and $R_V$ as well as a short proof of the associativity of $\\\\zhu(V)$ utilising elliptic functions.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe representation theory of $\\\\zhu(V)$ is closely connected with that of $V$ (for $V$ a conformal vertex algebra now). There are adjoint functors between the categories of $\\\\zhu(V)$-modules and of positive energy $V$-modules, and these functors induce bijections between the sets of isomorphism classes of simple objects in each category. The existence of an associative algebra with these properties is not in itself surprising since the category of all $V$-modules is equivalent to the category of smooth modules of its enveloping algebra $U(V) = \\\\bigoplus_{n \\\\in \\\\Z} U(V)_n$, and so the algebra $\\\\widetilde{U} = UU(V)_0 / (U(V) \\\\cdot U(V)_{>0})_0$ does the job. And indeed $\\\\zhu(V) \\\\cong \\\\widetilde{U}$. What is nontrivial is the presentation of $\\\\zhu(V)$ as an explicit quotient of $V$, which lends itself to practical applications.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe algebra $\\\\zhu(V)$ was introduced by Zhu in the context of his study of the behaviour of conformal blocks for singular families of elliptic curves with nodal singular fibre. Our use of elliptic functions to prove associativity of $\\\\zhu(V)$ lies closer, in fact, to this point of view on the latter than to its representation theoretic interpretation.\\r \\n\\\\end{nolabel} \\n\\n\\\\begin{nolabel}\\nLet $V$ be a vertex algebra and $f \\\\in \\\\mathbb{C}\\\\left( (t) \\\\right)$ a Laurent series. We have a bilinear operation $V \\\\otimes V \\\\rightarrow V$, \\\\[ a \\\\otimes b \\\\mapsto a_{(f)}b := \\\\res_t f(t)a(t)b \\\\]\\nwhich we refer to as the $(f)$-product. We study quotients of the form $Z_f(V) := V/\\\\left(V_{(f)}(T V ) \\\\right)$ equipped with the algebraic structure of $(f)$-product. Here $V_{(f)}(T V )$ is the  ideal in $V$ generated by $TV$ under the $(f)$-product. It turns out that associativity of such quotients (when well defined) imposes very restrictive conditions on $f$. Let $f(t) = \\\\zeta(t, \\\\omega_1, \\\\omega_2)$ be Weierstrass' zeta function, depending on the two periods $\\\\omega_{1},\\\\omega_2 \\\\in \\\\mathbb{C}$. This function does not quite satisfy the conditions guaranteeing associativity of $Z_f(V)$, but its limit $\\\\omega_1 \\\\rightarrow \\\\infty$ does satisfy these conditions, and one recovers Zhu's algebra $\\\\zhu(V)$ (or rather an isomorphic algebra found by Huang \\\\cite{Huang.duality} ). On the other hand the limit $\\\\omega_2 \\\\mapsto \\\\infty$ recovers Zhu's $C_2$-algebra $R_V$.\\n\\\\label{no:limits}\\n\\\\end{nolabel}\\n\\r\\n%The role played by $R_V$ in Zhu's work is more technical. Finite dimensionality of $R_V$ guarantees the existence of differential equations of Fuchsian type satisfied by the torus $1$-point functions of $V$ and consequently the convergence of the formal series defining the latter. Subsequent work has nevertheless revealed that $R_V$ and the scheme $X_V = \\\\spec{R_V}$ known as the \\\\emph{associated variety} have representation theoretic significance.

This follows from Lemma \\\\ref{zhu.closure} of the next section.

In fact the $\\\\zhu_c(V)$ are isomorphic \\\\cite{DK06} for all $c \\\\neq 0$. The algebra associated with (\\\\ref{C2.solution}) is Zhu's $C_2$-algebra, denoted $R_V$. The bracket $\\\\{a,b\\\\} = a(0)b$ is well defined on $R_V$ and makes it into a Poisson algebra.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n%% Recall that a formal deformation of an associative $\\\\C$-algebra $A$ is an assocative product $\\\\circ_t$ on the $\\\\C[[t]]$-algebra $A[[t]]$ that extends the product on $A$ in the sense that\\r\\n%% \\\\[\\r\\n%% \\\\left.{a \\\\circ_t b}\\\\right|_{t=0} = ab.\\r\\n%% \\\\]\\r\\n%% A formal deformation of a commutative algebra $A$ gives it the structure of a Poisson algebra via\\r\\n%% \\\\[\\r\\n%% \\\\{a,b\\\\} = \\\\left.\\\\frac{a \\\\circ_t b - b \\\\circ_t a}{t}\\\\right|_{t=0},\\r\\n%% \\\\]\\r\\n%% and the formal deformation is then said to be a deformation quantisation of the Poisson algebra $(A, \\\\{\\\\cdot,\\\\cdot\\\\})$.\\r\\n\\r\\nBefore proceeding we record a useful computation. Since $a_{(g)}\\\\vac = a_{(-2)}\\\\vac = -Ta$ we have $TV \\\\subset V_{(g)}V$.

If $g$ is taken to be $\\\\partial f$ then replacement of the ideal $V_{(g)}V$ with $TV + V_{(g)}V$ permits one to dispense with condition (\\\\ref{non.higher.condition}) while maintaining unitality of the quotient.

Let $f$ and $g$ be as in (\\\\ref{Zhu.solution}). The vector space $\\\\left<\\\\partial_z^{(k)} g | k \\\\in \\\\Z_+ \\\\right>$ is closed under multiplication by $f$ and by $g$.\\r\\n\\\\end{lemma}\\r\\n\\r\\n\\\\begin{proof}\\r\\nThe substitution $x = e^{cz}-1$ yields $f(z)=c(x^{-1}+1)$, $g(z)=-c^2(x^{-2}+x^{-1})$, and $\\\\partial_z = c(x+1)\\\\partial_x$. From this it is plain to see that $\\\\partial_z^{(j)}g$, $f \\\\partial_z^{(j)}g$ and $g \\\\partial_z^{(j)}g$ lie in $x^{-1}\\\\C[x^{-1}]$ for all $j \\\\in \\\\Z_+$.\\r\\n\\r\\nNow let $\\\\varepsilon : \\\\C((x))[[q]] \\\\rightarrow \\\\C((x))$ denote the quotient by the ideal generated by $q$. We observe that $\\\\varepsilon(Z) = f / c$ and $\\\\varepsilon(P) = -g / c^2$.\\r\\n\\r\\nSince $P$ is the Laurent expansion of an elliptic function it follows that, for each $j \\\\in \\\\Z_+$,\\r\\n\\\\[\\r\\nP \\\\partial_z^{(j)}P = \\\\al + \\\\sum_{k \\\\in \\\\Z_+} \\\\beta_k \\\\partial_z^{(k)}P,\\r\\n\\\\]\\r\\nfor some $\\\\al, \\\\beta_k \\\\in \\\\C[[q]]$. But since $\\\\varepsilon(P) = -g / c^2$ and $g \\\\partial_z^{(j)}g \\\\in x^{-1}\\\\C[x^{-1}]$ we see that $\\\\varepsilon(\\\\al) = 0$, hence $\\\\al \\\\in q\\\\,\\\\C[[q]]$. This proves at once the statements about closure with respect to $g$ and $P$.\\r\\n\\r\\nSince $\\\\varepsilon$ annihilates the image of $q \\\\partial_q$ and the functions (\\\\ref{formula.q.de.higher}) are elliptic, we may repeat the arguments above to deduce the statements about closure with respect to $f$ and $Z$ exactly as we did for $g$ and $P$.\\r\\n\\\\end{proof}\\r\\n\\r\\nAside from implying Proposition \\\\ref{zhu.is.assoc}, the Lemma \\\\ref{zhu.closure} is a source of classical identities among the constant terms of Eisenstein series. The following such identity is an example.\\r\\n\\\\begin{cor}\\r\\nFor each integer $n \\\\geq 2$ one has\\r\\n\\\\begin{align*}\\r\\n\\\\left( 1 - \\\\frac{n(n-1)}{2} \\\\right) \\\\frac{B_{n}}{n!} = \\\\sum_{i=2}^{n-2} (i-1) \\\\frac{B_{i}}{i!} \\\\cdot \\\\frac{B_{n-i}}{(n-i)!}.\\r\\n\\\\end{align*}\\r\\n\\r\\n\\\\end{cor}\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nIt is easy to adapt the proof of Lemma \\\\ref{zhu.closure} to show that the algebra defined in (\\\\ref{higher.zhu.half}), henceforth referred to as $\\\\zhu_{1/2}(V)$, is associative. We observe that $f_{1/2} = f + g$ and $g_{1/2} = f_{1/2}'$. The substitution $x = e^{z}-1$ yields $f_{1/2} = x^{-2} + 2x^{-1} + 1$ and $g_{1/2} = -2(x^{-3}+2x^{-2}+x^{-1})$. Now $\\\\partial^{(j)}g_{1/2}$, $f_{1/2} \\\\partial^{(j)}g_{1/2}$ and $g_{1/2} \\\\partial^{(j)}g_{1/2}$ lie in $x^{-1}\\\\C[x^{-1}]$ for all $j \\\\in \\\\Z_+$. The rest of the argument is identical. In fact this argument applies more generally. Put $F = f + p$ where $p$ is any linear combination of $g$ and its derivatives. Then the quotient $\\\\zhu_F(V) = V/J_F$, where $J_F = V_{(F')}V + TV$, equipped with the $F$-product is a unital associative algebra.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n% \\\\section{Conformal Blocks and the Zhu Algebra}\\\\label{section.blocks}\\r\\n\\r\\n% Following \\\\cite{FBZ.Book} we write $\\\\OO$ and $\\\\CK$ for the topological rings $\\\\C[[t]]$ and $\\\\C((t))$ respectively, $D = \\\\spec{\\\\OO}$ and $D^\\\\times = \\\\spec{\\\\CK}$ for the disc and punctured disc, $\\\\der_0\\\\OO = t\\\\C[[t]]\\\\partial_t$ and $\\\\der{\\\\CK} = \\\\C((t))\\\\partial_t$ for the Lie algebras of vector fields on $D$ and $D^\\\\times$ respectively, and $\\\\aut{\\\\OO}$ for the group of smooth automorphisms of $\\\\OO$.

See \\\\cite{Kodaira} \\\\cite{Schuett.Shioda}.\\r\\n\\r\\n%Every fibre of the family outside $t=0$ can be put in the form $X_t \\\\cong E_\\\\tau$ for some $\\\\tau$ depending on $t$. But looping once around $t=0$ induces a Dehn twist on the fibre. Indeed the singular fibre is of type II in Kodaira's classification, and he says that a loop around $t=0$ starting at $t_0$ must lift to a path in the upper half plane $\\\\HH$ that goes from $\\\\tau_0$ to $-1-1/\\\\tau_0$. Note that the cube of the transformation $\\\\tau \\\\mapsto -1-1/\\\\tau$ is the identity, and in fact the loop around $t=0$ gets lifted to a loop around the orbifold point of order $3$ in $\\\\HH / SL_2(\\\\Z)$. Consistent with all this is the fact that for this family $\\\\lim_{t \\\\rightarrow 0} j(t) = 0$, while indeed $j=0$ for the elliptic curve which corresponds to the orbifold point of order $3$.\\r\\n\\r\\n%% Using (\\\\ref{xcoord}) and Huang's formula (\\\\ref{huang.formula}), the quotient $H(X_t, 0, V) = V / \\\\left<V_{(\\\\wp)}V + V(0)V\\\\right>$ may be reexpressed in terms of $x$. At $t=0$ one has $x = -(1/2)z$ and $a_{(\\\\wp)}b = -2a(-2)b$. \\r\\n%% \\\\begin{prop}\\r\\n%% There is a coherent sheaf over $B$ whose fibre over $t \\\\neq 0$ is isomorphic to the space of coinvariants $H(X_t, 0, V)$ of the elliptic curve $X_t$, and whose fibre over $t=0$ is isomorphic to the $0^\\\\text{th}$ Poisson homology of the $C_2$-algebra $R_V$ of $V$.\\r\\n%%   \\\\end{prop}\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n%% {\\\\color{blue}At $t=12^3$ the singular fibre type is of type $\\\\text{III}^*$ in Kodaira's classification (a chain of spheres intersecting in a pattern governed by $E_7$. In general (i.e., in all cases except for the nodal curve) not only the singular fibre is singular, but the surface has a surface singularity. One has to resolve the singularity by blow ups. This is what introduces the extra components of the singular fibres. The point is: things might be a lot more suble than I have been thinking.}\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n%TO DO: explain why $R_V$ is a Poisson algebra, zeroth product, Poisson homology.

      "A $K3$ surface is a simply connected compact complex surface whose \n",

      "Theoretically, to consider an Enriques surface is equivalent to\n",
      "consider the pair of the covering $K3$ surface and the free involution.\n",
      "For example, the period \n",
