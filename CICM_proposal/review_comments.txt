This WIP paper proposes a system for extracting definitions from online
collections of mathematical documents (e.g. arXiV). It's certainly in the
scope of CICM and I think will lead to some interesting discussion about how
to approach the problem, how to progress with the system, and what users might
like out of it. It seems to be at a fairly early stage, but the paper shows
that the system should be feasible.

The paper is mostly about identifying definitions, and extracting the term
to be defined as well as its meaning. It's based on existing methods for
classifying text and identifying named entities in text. I think there is more
to say in future about performace in particular (there's a lot of papers to
process after all!) and about how the definitions will be organised, which is
stated as a goal of the system but at this stage there doesn't seem to be
anything which suggests how this might be done.

There's a few other small things I'd suggest at this stage:

It would be useful in the introduction to say more about what you mean by
"organising the mathematical lexion both by dependency and semantically"
perhaps with an example, since the rest of the paper is about identifying the
definitions only.

p1 "As well as..." - this sentence seems to be incomplete.

p2 Capitalise XML/HTML. You could also say in what ways the LaTeX source has
to be further processed.

p3 I think you're measuring the accuracy based on the LaTeX, is that right?
I'd be interested to see some examples of false positives/negatives as well as
the examples in table 2.

%%p5 typo "When ran" => "When run"
