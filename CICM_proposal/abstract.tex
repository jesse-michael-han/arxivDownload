We propose a method to gather large amounts of  mathematical definitions from  mathematical documents available online.
Recent work indicates that text classification algorithms can have excellent accuracy  at determining when a certain paragraph is in fact a definition or not. These algorithms are trained on large math corpora available online like the arXiv website. The \LaTeX{}    source code of these documents is first converted into a more structured format like XML or HTML with the software package LaTeXML. The training data for the classifier is then obtained by searching for the definitions that the author labeled with a \LaTeX{} macro. The second phase of the system consists of extracting the term being defined from each definition. This task is performed by a Named Entity Recognition (NER) model trained using data from websites with mathematical content. The data is finally organized according to several different properties like semantic similarity and content dependency.
