We endow $\mathcal{C}$ with the chaotic topology
(Sites, Example \ref{sites-example-indiscrete}), i.e., we endow
$\mathcal{C}$ with the structure of a site where coverings are given by
identities so that all presheaves are sheaves.
Moreover, we endow $\mathcal{C}$ with two sheaves of rings. The first
is the sheaf $\mathcal{O}$ which sends to object $(P, \alpha)$ to $P$.
Then second is the constant sheaf $B$, which we will denote
$\underline{B}$. We obtain the following diagram of morphisms of
ringed topoi
\begin{equation}
\label{equation-pi}
\vcenter{
\xymatrix{
(\Sh(\mathcal{C}), \underline{B}) \ar[r]_i \ar[d]_\pi &
(\Sh(\mathcal{C}), \mathcal{O}) \\
(\Sh(*), B)
}
}
\end{equation}
The morphism $i$ is the identity on underlying topoi and
$i^\sharp : \mathcal{O} \to \underline{B}$ is the obvious map.
The map $\pi$ is as in Cohomology on Sites, Example
\ref{sites-cohomology-example-category-to-point}.
An important role will be played in the following
by the derived functors
